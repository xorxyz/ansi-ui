# ansi-ui

A curses-like library with a high-level API for Node and the browser.

This library is a fork of `chjj/blessed`.

Goals:

1. Stay as close as possible to the original `blessed` APIs.
2. Strip down, maybe modularize.
3. Have everything work in the browser by default.


## Install

``` bash
$ npm install ansi-ui
```

## Usage

See [USAGE](USAGE.md).


## Example

See [EXAMPLE](EXAMPLE.md).


## Testing

Most tests contained in the `test/` directory are interactive. 
It's up to the programmer to determine whether the test is properly displayed. In the future it might be better to do something similar to vttest.
